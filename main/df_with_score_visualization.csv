1894,-1,Theresa  at Manulife was amazingly informative  helpful   humorous  The  stars here are for her and not necessarily for Manulife as a company  She actually called us back when the call was dropped  Perhaps you can pass my comments here on to Manulife   We don t like the fact that Manulife seems to be the only show in town in Canada  Every company you contact  like BCAA  our TD Visa etc are all underwritten by Manulife  No competition there   I don t know why Manulife can t just look at our health history themselves instead of counting on seniors  poor memories to remember every appointment or affliction  like an ingrown toenail  they might ve had over the last five years   It s very stressful   then you hear horror stories of people being denied coverage after the fact for something critical like an accident they had while they re away on holiday because they forgot to tell somebody about  for example  an ingrown toenail they had four years ago  or pre existing hiccoughs   which have told nothing to do with the accident  It s nuts  It seems dishonest   It s not as if insurance companies are not making enough profits for their shareholders and it makes us all feel like criminals if you don t remember every last thing   It makes everyone very suspicious and personally I don t feel safe travelling because of may be forgetting something  Let s hope we don t need the service we re paying Manulife to provide   This is one of my sister s recent experiences with Manulife   Manulife controls all kinds of insurance plans  I have a plan with Manulife and a separate one with Benecaid for a health spending account  I tried to get on to a different plan from the Manulife current one through COPA  then the Alberta Engineers Society member   the NWT Engineers Society  member   also AMA and they are all underwritten by Manulife and I cannot cancel current to get another or I will have to go uncovered for a two year period    ps  Our father had an insurance business and worked for Economical mutual his entire career ,2020-01-22,0.072,0.097,0.831,-0.9044,2020,2020-01
