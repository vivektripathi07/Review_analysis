I do have one suggestion which is for all companies who offer travel insurance. Many of us have separate emergency medical insurance already.

No company offers such an inclusive trip cancellation, trip interruption, baggage lost/delayed without the medical coverage.

So I called, got a quote and said I would continue searching. Called back to purchase the policy as quoted, and the rep (I had asked for Adam as that was the name I had written) was not the original one. This fellow was basically unintelligible, and garbled to the point the he sounded impaired. As a result he could not locate the quote even with a file # and said he would get back to me. In the meantime, I went back online and successfully obtained the required insurance. To his credit, he did call me back to ask if I actually got a quote from ‘us’ as he couldn’t find it. Told him not worry as I had already made the purchase. You provide great policies, but do need to better screen your sales reps."

Each time the Rep on the other end in pleasant, knowledgeable and prompt in their dealings. This time, I dealt with Teresa whom I've dealt with on a few occasions and she is the definition of a star employee. She knows her stuff and easy to work with. So, Snowbird Advisor Insurance, hold onto her. She a real ASSET to your company and to us who pay the freight.

Hopefully, I won't ever have to make a claim but the REAL test is how the company supports the customer in a time of need and hopefully they don't scurry down the rabbit hole if it comes time to pay. For now, based on the manner of how they do business, I'm going to guess they'll be there in a time of need."

By the way, exactly how in HELL can a hemmorhoid that has been there doing NOTHING for 45 years be a health concern??? Honestly! Ridiculous! I am in better shape now than ever. I do not want a hemmorhoid covered. I do not want a tickle in my throat covered. I do not want a stiff muscle covered. I want to be covered for emergencies such as a broken leg or burst appendix. What a pile of facetious crap! For shame!"
Overall experience was good,"Overall experience was good. Online health questionnaire was easy to work with. The quote given was certainly competitive, as I had checked with several others. I did have to phone to get some clarification about cancellation policy, but got through to a person quickly who answered my questions.
It would be nice if information was kept so it wasn't necessary to re-do all the questionnaire entries each time a new policy is wanted. This is what Medi-Quote does.

Big disappointment,"I investigated travel insurance in July 2024. I was quoted $394. for 8 days in January. I was happy to get that. However, yesterday, October 21 2024, I decided to purchase it, 10 days. My medical condition had not changed, in fact, has got better. I was quoted $613. - a $ 219. increase: it was explained to me that it was Manufacturers Life and not Snowbird that changed things. THAT just does not do it for me: Manufacturers has tarnished your profile. You are ok with that? On the first quote it should be clearly NOTED on the form that after 30 days, quotes mean nothing. This is bad business practice. Unfortunately for you, in chatting with fellow travellers, I would have to caution them about this disappointing development. I am happy to get the insurance...but...."

Too many pressured questions requiring…,"Too many pressured questions requiring yes/no answers. I don’t know all the medical answers and felt pressured to guess with a yes or no. Feels like a set up for future problems to remember what I actually guessed. I am bound to guess differently in the future on some things while It is easy to remember the truth! I was threatened several times with, “ you must say no if you want the insurance”. I was shaking for hours after this call and almost hung up several times as it was so stressful. I am 76, have had complicated health issues as my age group does, and these yes/no questions are not always easy to answer. I can say with confidence I am a fit and active 76 year old, but my immune system is compromised with Lupus and there is uncertainty what that means for me and health risk. Thank you for being more considerate in the future with questions that accommodate the realities of my age and past health issues. This current process is insulting to me and very challenging for your interviewer who is simply trying to answer complexity with simple answers. Thank you."

I contacted them by the number to clarify my pre-existing diagnoses. The agent I spoke with said my diagnoses are considered stable. However the SnowbirdAdvisor website erred and my premium should be almost 5 times the premium charged. I advised him that I was completely surprised by this premium and would not have agreed to it. He informed me that after escalating the issue to his supervisor the company was cancelling the policy. He arranged for a secure line to submission my credit card information. He then told me the SnowBirdAdvisory Insurance were not refunding me the premium. He said he would discuss with the accounts department and call me when the refund was processed.
It is 4 days later and I not only have not received my refund but no confirmation that the policy has been canceled!"

First time user,"This was my first time purchasing from this company. I inadvertently missed a couple of medical items I should have put in for my husband. This was because the form does not have a list of medical conditions to answer questions about, but a blank space for you to type in the condition(s). I then had to call and speak to an agent. The questions she asked was a very long list. I wouldn't have thought having covid 2 yrs ago or having cataract surgery 7 yrs ago, would be something I needed to report. If the form had all these things listed and boxes to check or write in, it would have made the process a lot easier to get through and waiting on the line for a person for 3/4 of an hour would be avoided. The agent was very nice and very thorough."
Ease of application,"The website was easy to navigate and didn’t require you to endlessly scroll through a calendar month by month for 65 years to arrive at your birthdate for entry.

Theresa was amazingly informative & helpful,"Theresa, at Manulife was amazingly informative, helpful & humorous. The 5stars here are for her and not necessarily for Manulife as a company. She actually called us back when the call was dropped. Perhaps you can pass my comments here on to Manulife?

We don’t like the fact that Manulife seems to be the only show in town in Canada. Every company you contact, like BCAA, our TD Visa etc are all underwritten by Manulife. No competition there.

I don’t know why Manulife can’t just look at our health history themselves instead of counting on seniors’ poor memories to remember every appointment or affliction, like an ingrown toenail, they might’ve had over the last five years.

It’s very stressful - then you hear horror stories of people being denied coverage after the fact for something critical like an accident they had while they’re away on holiday because they forgot to tell somebody about, for example, an ingrown toenail they had four years ago, or pre-existing hiccoughs - which have told nothing to do with the accident! It’s nuts. It seems dishonest.

It’s not as if insurance companies are not making enough profits for their shareholders and it makes us all feel like criminals if you don’t remember every last thing.

It makes everyone very suspicious and personally I don’t feel safe travelling because of may be forgetting something. Let’s hope we don’t need the service we’re paying Manulife to provide.

This is one of my sister’s recent experiences with Manulife: “Manulife controls all kinds of insurance plans. I have a plan with Manulife and a separate one with Benecaid for a health spending account. I tried to get on to a different plan from the Manulife current one through COPA, then the Alberta Engineers Society(member), the NWT Engineers Society (member), also AMA and they are all underwritten by Manulife and I cannot cancel current to get another or I will have to go uncovered for a two year period!”

ps. Our father had an insurance business and worked for Economical mutual his entire career."
