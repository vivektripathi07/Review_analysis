1,This was my third time purchasing a policy and it was not a good experience  First I tried the online application  as I had in the past  and things kept freezing  So I called  got a quote and said I would continue searching  Called back to purchase the policy as quoted  and the rep  I had asked for Adam as that was the name I had written  was not the original one  This fellow was basically unintelligible  and garbled to the point the he sounded impaired  As a result he could not locate the quote even with a file   and said he would get back to me  In the meantime  I went back online and successfully obtained the required insurance  To his credit  he did call me back to ask if I actually got a quote from  us  as he couldn t find it  Told him not worry as I had already made the purchase  You provide great policies  but do need to better screen your sales reps

1,Best price I could find  One can only rate any insurance based on when if a claim is needed  Until then  it s a gamble with any company 
1,Call was answered quickly by a live person  All staff were polite  friendly and helpful  The ability to input the credit card to pay for the policy was over the top useless  Declined my card after each try  Had to call my bank    that call was a twenty min wait  then had to transferred to someone else  another ten min wait  Found that because there was an error in the first time i entered my card number  tour system would not let any or the other entries go through so all declined   If the system is intended to be used that way to recieve credit card numbers  it is not worth it

1,I would like to share my experience with Snowbird Advisor Insurance in the hopes that other members don t also get fooled   Upon viewing the    discount for members on the Snowbird website  I went online to book travel insurance for my trip  I dutifully answered all the questions and eventually got to the cart  but the discount was nowhere in sight   I called Snowbird insurance only to be told that the discount only applies to some travel insurance   not all  Really   I expect better from Snowbird Advisor  Shame on you 
0,Your representative Jenny  was very polite and knowledgeable  First time in   years coverage had we been offered a tax receipt   We do use Snowbird for our travels but feel if there is not a claim  and we have used it for   years   there should be a percentage rebate after non use of our policies  Cost went up over           for us this year making it almost              pensioners cannot afford it 
1,Quick and easy  The price was good

1,The agents that I spoke with on the phone were pleasant and knowledgeable  They promptly sent my quote and questionnaire with clear instructions on how to pay for my quote  So I was pleased 
-1,We canceled our insurance and switched to Costco  who also is with manulife  Snowbird only has option for    million and Costco is   million which is plenty and cost is much lower  Too bad snowbirds don t have the option for   million 
-1,Did not like that the rate has hiked up so much  Sad everyone is rising prices on everything but income  As seniors we are really getting bashed  
-1,They accused me of answering falsely as they asked me questions they did not ask last year  By the way  exactly how in HELL can a hemmorhoid that has been there doing NOTHING for    years be a health concern    Honestly  Ridiculous  I am in better shape now than ever  I do not want a hemmorhoid covered  I do not want a tickle in my throat covered  I do not want a stiff muscle covered  I want to be covered for emergencies such as a broken leg or burst appendix  What a pile of facetious crap  For shame 
1,Overall experience was good  Online health questionnaire was easy to work with  The quote given was certainly competitive  as I had checked with several others  I did have to phone to get some clarification about cancellation policy  but got through to a person quickly who answered my questions  It would be nice if information was kept so it wasn t necessary to re do all the questionnaire entries each time a new policy is wanted  This is what Medi Quote does  I did purchase Snowbird Insurance 
1,I appreciate the opportunity to shop various insurance companies  features and rates  and then select the one that best meets my needs  This year took almost a week to finalize the payment due to a broken phone link  versus last year s payment in minutes  I trust the link will be fixed before next year s annual renewal 
1,The woman that took our call was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions  We were very pleased with our experience
1,The insurance rep who took my call was knowledgeable and very helpful  I had tried other quotes from other companies and   because of how easy it was to apply and receive confirmation and my policy   I feel comfortable recommending this company  Of course  the only way to truly judge this company is what happens if I ever needed their services  I hope that never happens but I m trusting that if I ever do need to make a claim they are just as good   
1,I have gotten my travel medical insurance through Snowbird Advisor for   years now  Even though it is the same insurance company I had been using before them  it is still less expensive getting the insurance through SA  Fast and efficient

1,I investigated travel insurance in July       I was quoted       for   days in January  I was happy to get that  However  yesterday  October          I decided to purchase it     days  My medical condition had not changed  in fact  has got better  I was quoted         a        increase  it was explained to me that it was Manufacturers Life and not Snowbird that changed things  THAT just does not do it for me  Manufacturers has tarnished your profile  You are ok with that  On the first quote it should be clearly NOTED on the form that after    days  quotes mean nothing  This is bad business practice  Unfortunately for you  in chatting with fellow travellers  I would have to caution them about this disappointing development  I am happy to get the insurance   but    
1,Customer service was excellent  Receive clear and precise information

1,Friendly service and a reasonable price 
1,Too many pressured questions requiring yes no answers  I don t know all the medical answers and felt pressured to guess with a yes or no  Feels like a set up for future problems to remember what I actually guessed  I am bound to guess differently in the future on some things while It is easy to remember the truth  I was threatened several times with    you must say no if you want the insurance   I was shaking for hours after this call and almost hung up several times as it was so stressful  I am     have had complicated health issues as my age group does  and these yes no questions are not always easy to answer  I can say with confidence I am a fit and active    year old  but my immune system is compromised with Lupus and there is uncertainty what that means for me and health risk  Thank you for being more considerate in the future with questions that accommodate the realities of my age and past health issues  This current process is insulting to me and very challenging for your interviewer who is simply trying to answer complexity with simple answers  Thank you 
1,Talking to an English speaking individual that I can understand and who understands my questions was very important to us  Fortunately we have not required to place a claim so I can t comment on any   experience   We were very pleased that as long as everything is listed  we are covered with any preexisting condition 
1,The policy was simple to acquire and quick  It might be better to see a table with rates shown for various age and length of vacation stays instead of just a rate from the agent at the end of the questionnaire  They should also offer a loyalty discount structure  Fortunately I have not had to make a claim yet so can t comment on that process

1,Buying travel insurance can be a bit overwhelming given the many options out there  Seasonally  we always stick with Snowbird Advisor for our travel insurance needs  This time  I changed age brackets and was not impressed with the initial cost quote  so my advisor worked hard to get me a plan and rate I was comfortable with  I ll never be happy with the cost of travel insurance but I feel that Snowbird Advisor tries hard to satisfy our needs and ensures we understand the process  Their team is great

1,The website was easy to navigate and didn t require you to endlessly scroll through a calendar month by month for    years to arrive at your birthdate for entry  Several of the alternative providers required this kind of mindless activity just for the privilege of getting them to give you a quote  End result was a quick cost effective quote for full year travel coverage  Thx

1,Knowledge and friendliness of Agent  Crystal Boss 
-1,Theresa  at Manulife was amazingly informative  helpful   humorous  The  stars here are for her and not necessarily for Manulife as a company  She actually called us back when the call was dropped  Perhaps you can pass my comments here on to Manulife   We don t like the fact that Manulife seems to be the only show in town in Canada  Every company you contact  like BCAA  our TD Visa etc are all underwritten by Manulife  No competition there   I don t know why Manulife can t just look at our health history themselves instead of counting on seniors  poor memories to remember every appointment or affliction  like an ingrown toenail  they might ve had over the last five years   It s very stressful   then you hear horror stories of people being denied coverage after the fact for something critical like an accident they had while they re away on holiday because they forgot to tell somebody about  for example  an ingrown toenail they had four years ago  or pre existing hiccoughs   which have told nothing to do with the accident  It s nuts  It seems dishonest   It s not as if insurance companies are not making enough profits for their shareholders and it makes us all feel like criminals if you don t remember every last thing   It makes everyone very suspicious and personally I don t feel safe travelling because of may be forgetting something  Let s hope we don t need the service we re paying Manulife to provide   This is one of my sister s recent experiences with Manulife   Manulife controls all kinds of insurance plans  I have a plan with Manulife and a separate one with Benecaid for a health spending account  I tried to get on to a different plan from the Manulife current one through COPA  then the Alberta Engineers Society member   the NWT Engineers Society  member   also AMA and they are all underwritten by Manulife and I cannot cancel current to get another or I will have to go uncovered for a two year period    ps  Our father had an insurance business and worked for Economical mutual his entire career
